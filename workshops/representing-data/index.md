Workshop - Representing Data
=========================

This workshop will allow students to have hands-on experience of designing and exchanging data using both formats - XML and JSON - covered in this week, as well as providing exposure to associated technologies such as Javascript and JQuery. The experience will provide the tools that will be heavily used in the individual and group projects (e.g. development of XML DTD designs).
