Workshop - Infrastructure
=========================

This workshop introduces students to the fundamental mechanics of computer communication across the Internet. We discuss HTTP, HTML (briefly – this is covered in more detail in week 4) and CGI – their construction, history and the basics of how they are used to transmit information. Slides are presented on each area then a set of guided questions are provided to complete during the tutorial which show how to use the tools for exploring HTTP and CGI. Finally a set of more extended exercises are provided which students can complete outside class – these require more in-depth construction of HTML forms and Python scripts to understand HTTP and CGI more fully.
