Exercises:
Play around with different events (like hover) and different effects (like fadeIn).
Download jquery_demo.zip and try to recreate the page without looking at the underlying code.

Download ajax.zip and upload the ZIP file to IVLE. This package demonstrates a simple calculator using Ajax call in jQuery.
Clicking the button will send the expression (data) as part of the Ajax call to a Python script (ajax.py). The result of the expression is returned back by the Python script either as XML or JSON. The success event handler will then display the result in the textarea on page.

Inspect the ajax.py to see how the Ajax response is constructed.
