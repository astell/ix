Workshop - Visualisation
=========================

This workshop will allow students to have a hands-on experience of using spreadsheet and `matplotlib` to do basic data visualisation.

<a href="visualisation.zip" file="code"> Python-based Visualisation using matplotlib (Jupyter Notebook)</a>

To run the notebook, unzip the zip file to a local directory and simply run:

    c:\> jupyter notebook

This command should launch a jupyter notebook in the browser. Open `visualisation.ipynb` to see the notebook.

---------

- [Matplotlib Gallery](http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html)<br />
  Huge range of plot produced using Matplotlib. Includes commented code examples. Good place to start when deciding what plot to use and how to do it.
- [Randal Olson - Beautiful Visualisations with Matplotlib](http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/28/how-to-make-beautiful-data-visualizations-in-python-with-matplotlib/)<br />
  Blog post that explains how to make Matplotlib plots pretty. Good commented code examples. Includes an example of an interactive plot.
- [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/)<br />
  Set of well-researched colour palettes. Includes palettes for sequential, diverging or qualitative datasets. Allows you to select only those that are colour-blind safe. Great place to look when choosing colours for plot.
- [Martin Krzywinski](http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/)<br />
  Canadian bioinformatician, designer and creator of the Circos plot. Blog posts on a range of data design topics, visualisations for explaining statistical concepts and events such as Pi day. Point out the ‘Points of Significance’ Nature column on good data visualisation.
- [FiveThiryEight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/)<br />
  Nate Silver’s data blog. Statistical analysis of a range of topics including sport, economics, politics etc. Many of the posts have excellent plots.
- [Karl Broman - Top Ten Worst Graphs](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/topten_worstgraphs/)
