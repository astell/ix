Workshop 01 - Setting Up and Representing Data with XML
=========================

This workshop will allow students to have hands-on experience of designing and exchanging data using both formats - XML, as well as setting up and getting comfortable with Python infrastructure. The experience will provide the tools that will be heavily used in the individual and group projects (e.g. development of XML DTD designs).
