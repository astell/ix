<title>Subject Overview</title>

## Subject Description

This subject explores various computational methods to represent, transform, and make sense of large, diverse sets of data such as share market prices, scientific data or demograpic data. Topics covered include: Extensible Markup Language (XML) and associated web technologies, representing and manipulating data using spreadsheet tools; basic web page construction using HTML and style-sheets; representing and manipulating information on the web using a scripting language. A series of workshops together with a semester-long project will give you practical experience in solving data-intensive problems involving computers, people and the Web.

## How is this subject different to Foundations of Computing?
This subject builds on the knowledge and skills developed in Foundations of Computings.


Foundations of Computing | Foundation of Informatics
--- | ---
computation | representation
structured data | semi-structured data
static data | live (web) data sources in context
Python | Python, XML, XHTML, JSON, CSS
programming skills (machine-oriented) | applied (human-oriented)

The programming component of the subject will use Python, which you have learned in Foundation of Computings. If you feel that you need to refresh your Python skills, you can go through a series of self-paced online worksheets, included in the Informatics Virtual Learning Environment (IVLE). You will need to use the Firefox web browser to access IVLE. You will also need to know your University username and password.

## Staff

The following people are involved in this subject:

&nbsp; | Name	| Email
--- | --- | ---
Coordinator/Lecturer |	Mr Ivo Widjaja | ivow(at)unimelb(dot)edu(dot)au
Coordinator/Lecturer	| Mr Anthony Stell |	anthony.stell(at)unimelb(dot)edu(dot)au
Tutor | &nbsp; | &nbsp;

The lecturers are responsible for the overall organization of the subject and for the selection of lecture material, workshop exercises and practical assignments.

The lecturers may be contacted by email appointment.

## Lectures and Workshops

Each week, two consecutive lectures are offered on Wednesday. The purpose of lectures is to present the principles of the subject along with worked examples, and to introduce the material that will be developed in workshops. Much of the information presented in lectures will be available via the subject homepage

Each week, starting in week two of semester, you will be expected to attend a two-hour workshop (tutorial & practical lab), held in the lab in the Alice Hoy Building. The purposes of workshops are:

to work on the week's worksheet;
to give you an opportunity to raise questions about the subject;
to address any problems you are having;
to work with your project team; and
to discuss other relevant aspects of the subject.

Attendance at workshops is compulsory.

## Text
There is no required textbook for this subject.

There are other texts on Python programming which you might find helpful for reference purposes; some are freely download-able, e.g. How to Think Like a (Python) Programmer http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/. There are other freely available online resources on web topics such as http://www.w3schools.com/.

## Dissemination of Information
All subject information including lecture notes and worksheets, will be available via the University's Learning Management System (LMS).
You will be expected to visit the subject site on the LMS as often as you can and take note of the information posted there. You are also expected to read email sent to your university email address. A wide range of other resources are also provided on the web page, and you are encouraged to browse it several times during the course of the semester.

## Assessment

### Hurdle Requirement:
To pass the subject as a whole, you must pass both the continuous assessment during semester, and the final exam. If you fail one of these components, but still achieve a pass mark for the subject as a whole, you will receive a failing grade of NH.

Project: The project, worth 60%, is divided into three stages. Please see the project page for detail (TBA).
Exam: A written two-hour examination at the end of semester is worth 40% of your overall mark. The exam will require detailed knowledge of the lectures and some of the workshops, including the project. A sample exam will be given out towards the end of semester.

## Total workload
In total, we expect you to spend about 11-12 hours per week on this subject, starting in Week Two and continuing through until the exam. To help you reach this target, you are encouraged to prepare a complete study timetable that shows, for this subject, the following twelve hours:

Lectures: Two hours of lecture attendance, plus one hour of lecture review. Each review session should be prior to the next lecture, to allow you to work through the content of the previous lecture and consolidate your understanding (3 hours).
Workshops: Two hours of workshop attendance, plus an extra two hour to review a worksheet if required (4 hours).
Assessment: There is project work throughout the semester, totalling 48 hours, so on average (4 hours).

When the similar demands from your other three subjects are fitted into the equation, it is clear that you need to spend 40-48 hours per week on your University study. If you have outside interests (including work) that consume more than 15 hours per week, you are jeopardising your chances of successfully completing a full-time first-year subject load. If your outside interests cannot be restricted to fewer than 12 hours per week, you should consider taking only three subjects per semester.

## How to get help
Discussion Forum: This is the best place to have your (non-personal/confidential) questions answered, not only by the lecturers, but by other students.
Your Tutor: Your tutor has been chosen for his technical and teaching abilities, and will be able to answer most questions you have about the content of the subject. However, your tutor is not available for consultation outside workshop times, unless for a specific help session.
Your Lecturer: You should also feel free to approach your lecturer - he is the final arbiter of all that happens in the subject. It may be necessary to contact him briefly in the first instance to set a time for a consultation. Immediately after lecturers is also a reasonable time to ask quick questions. You are welcome to contact lecturers by email, but note that general questions of interest to other students should be sent directly to the Discussion Forum, where lecturers (or other students) will help.

## Academic Honesty Policy

Definitions from the University's website:

#### What is plagiarism?
Plagiarism is the act of representing as one's own original work the creative works of another, without appropriate acknowledgment of the author or source. (Creative works may include published and unpublished written documents, interpretations, computer software, designs, music, sounds, images, photographs, and ideas or ideological frameworks gained through working with another person or in a group. These works may be in print and/or electronic media.)

#### What is collusion?
Collusion is the presentation by a student of an assignment as his or her own which is in fact the result in whole or in part of unauthorised collaboration with another person or persons. Collusion involves the cooperation of two or more students in plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct. Both the student presenting the assignment and the student(s) willingly supplying unauthorised material (colluders) are considered participants in the act of academic misconduct.

#### Why is plagiarism so serious?
As outlined above, plagiarism is taking and presenting the thoughts, writings, etc, of other people as your own. In not crediting the source, a person is guilty of intellectual fraud. It is unacceptable at all times; it is completely unacceptable at the University of Melbourne.

If a student is found to have deliberately plagiarised the work of another - including copying the work of other students - the penalties are severe.

Here are links to the University's web site on Academic Honesty and, in particular, the policy on academic misconduct.

In the case of programming assignments, the code you have submitted may be checked for plagiarism and collusion, both against other students' code and many programming resources on the web.

## Special Consideration
If your studies have been significantly affected by illness or other problems, you may be entitled to special consideration. The official University policy is here, and application for Special Consideration can be made through Student Portal.

## Language and Learning Support
The Academic Skills Unit provides excellent services to assist you with your study and language skills. Here you'll find a great range of resources, including Airport.
