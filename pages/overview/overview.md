Subject Description
-------------------

This subject explores various computational methods to represent, transform, and make sense of large, diverse sets of data such as share market prices, scientific data or demograpic data. Topics covered include: Extensible Markup Language (XML) and associated web technologies, representing and manipulating data using spreadsheet tools; basic web page construction using HTML and style-sheets; representing and manipulating information on the web using a scripting language. A series of workshops together with a semester-long project will give you practical experience in solving data-intensive problems involving computers, people and the Web.

How is this subject different to Foundations of Computing?
----------------------------------------------------------
This subject builds on the knowledge and skills developed in Foundations of Computing.

Foundations of Computing | Foundation of Informatics
--- | ---
computation | representation
structured data | semi-structured data
static data | live (web) data sources in context
Python | Python, XML, XHTML, JSON, CSS
programming skills (machine-oriented) | applied (human-oriented)

The programming component of the subject will use Python, which you have learned in Foundation of Computing.

The subject coordinators are responsible for the overall organization of the subject and for the design of lecture material, workshop exercises, and assignments. For any enquiries, the lecturers may be contacted by email appointment.

Lectures and Workshops
----------------------

Each week, two lectures are offered on Monday and Tuesday. The purpose of lectures is to present the principles of the subject along with worked examples, and to introduce the material that will be developed in workshops. Much of the information presented in lectures will be linked from the LMS subject schedule.

Each week, **starting in week two of semester**, you will be expected to attend a two-hour workshop (tutorial & practical lab). The purposes of workshops are:

- to work on the week's worksheet;
- to give you an opportunity to raise questions about the subject;
- to address any problems you are having;
- to work with your project team; and
- to discuss other relevant aspects of the subject.

Attendance at workshops is compulsory.

Textbook
--------
There is no required textbook for this subject. Relevant resources will be posted in the lecture page and you are expected to visit this page before the lecture.

Dissemination of Information
--------------------------
All subject information including lecture notes and worksheets, will be available via the University's Learning Management System (LMS). You will be expected to visit the subject site on the LMS as often as you can and take advantage of a wide range of resources provided there.

*You are also expected to read email sent to your university email address. Very important notices such as cancellation of workshops/lectures or change of deadlines will be send to this email address.*

Assessment
----------

**Hurdle Requirement**:

To pass the subject as a whole, you must pass both the continuous assessment during semester (project), and the final exam. If you fail one of these components, but still achieve a pass mark for the subject as a whole, you will receive a failing grade of NH.

The assessment consists of two parts:

- **Project**: The project, worth 40%, is divided into three stages. Please see the project page for detail (TBA).
- **Final Exam**: A written two-hour examination at the end of semester is worth 60% of your overall mark. The detailed knowledge of the lectures, the workshops, and the project are the possible sources of the exam questions. A sample exam will be given out in the week 12.

Total workload
--------------

In total, we expect you to spend about 14-15 hours per week on this subject. To help you reach this target, you are encouraged to prepare a complete study timetable that shows, for this subject, the following hours:

- **Lectures**: Two hours of lecture attendance, plus one hour of lecture review. Each review session should be prior to the next lecture, to allow you to work through the content of the previous lecture and consolidate your understanding (3 hours).
- **Workshops**: Two hours of workshop attendance, plus an extra two hour to review workshop exercises if required (4 hours).
- **Project**: A project work needs to be carried out throughout the semester (7-8 hours).


How to get help
---------------

- **LMS Discussion Forum**: This is the best place to have your (non-personal/confidential) questions answered, not only by the lecturers, but by other students. Subscribe to the forum and search answers in the existing threads before posting your own.
- **Your Tutor**: Your tutor will be available to answer most questions you have about the content of the subject. However, your tutor is not available for consultation outside workshop times, unless for a specific help session. Please refrain yourself from spamming your tutor with questions.
- **Your Lecturer**: You should also feel free to approach your lecturer - he is the final arbiter of all that happens in the subject. Immediately after lecture is also a reasonable time to ask quick questions. You are welcome to contact lecturers by email, but note that general questions of interest to other students should be sent directly to the Discussion Forum, where lecturers (or other students) will help.

Academic honesty and plagiarism
-----------------------

Definitions from the University's [website](https://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/):

#### What is plagiarism?
Plagiarism is the act of representing as one's own original work the creative works of another, without appropriate acknowledgment of the author or source. (Creative works may include published and unpublished written documents, interpretations, computer software, designs, music, sounds, images, photographs, and ideas or ideological frameworks gained through working with another person or in a group. These works may be in print and/or electronic media.)

#### What is collusion?
Collusion is the presentation by a student of an assignment as his or her own which is in fact the result in whole or in part of unauthorised collaboration with another person or persons. Collusion involves the cooperation of two or more students in plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct. Both the student presenting the assignment and the student(s) willingly supplying unauthorised material (colluders) are considered participants in the act of academic misconduct.

#### Why is plagiarism so serious?
As outlined above, plagiarism is taking and presenting the thoughts, writings, etc, of other people as your own. In not crediting the source, a person is guilty of intellectual fraud. It is unacceptable at all times; it is completely unacceptable at the University of Melbourne.

If a student is found to have deliberately plagiarised the work of another - including copying the work of other students - **the penalties are severe**.

*In the case of programming assignments, the code you have submitted may be checked for plagiarism and collusion, both against other students' code and many programming resources on the web.*

Special Consideration
---------------------

If your studies have been significantly affected by illness or other *severe* problems, you may be entitled to special consideration. The official University policy is [here](http://policy.unimelb.edu.au/MPF1030), and application for Special Consideration can be made through Student Portal.

Language and Learning Support
-----------------------------

The [Academic Skills Unit](http://services.unimelb.edu.au/academicskills/undergrads) provides excellent services to assist you with your study and language skills. Here you'll find a great range of resources, including [Airport](https://airport.unimelb.edu.au/gate1/).
