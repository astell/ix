Introduction
------------

The aim of the project is to give you practical experience with the skills that you learn in the subject, namely:

- **Understanding and Designing Data Representation**, including XML design, processing, and validation.
- **Providing a Way to Interact with Data**, including Python web programming.
- **Providing Simple Data Processing and Analysis**.
- **Representing Data**, including visualisation and presentation using XHTML and CSS.

The project is divided into three phases of increasing complexity. The first phase is done individually, and will serve as a preparatory step for the second and third phase, which will be done in **3-person groups**.

### Phase 1 – Design and analysis of data representation (individual, 10%, due around week 4).

You will be given a dataset in CSV format. Your task is to design a new XML format for storing some basic properties that summarises the dataset. The properties and the XML data are to be generated using Python program. Detail on phase 2.

### Phase 2 – Solving a practical data manipulation problem (group, 10%, due around week 8).

You will be given a data set. Your task is to solve some data processing problem by using your skills in managing, manipulating and visualising data in spreadsheet. Detail on phase 2.

### Phase 3 – Developing an application that enables the presentation, visualisation, and analysis of data (group, 20%, due around week 12).

You will build a non-trivial web-application which combines many of the skills and technologies you have learnt during the semester. It is also an opportunity for you to gain experience working in a team on a challenging task. You will implement an interactive web application in Python, which will be hosted on IVLE. Details on phase 3.
