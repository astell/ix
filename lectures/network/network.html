About Network?
====================

- Who are the most important members of a network?
- Which members are located in the periphery?
- Which members have more possibility to connect to others?
- Which members are the most crucial to maintain the connectedness in a group?
- Can the network broken down into smaller sub-networks?

networks as graphs
=================================

- a collection of nodes (also called nodes), and lines connecting them (usually called edges). In social network a node is a person and an edge is a relationship between two persons
- directed graph: edges own directionality between two nodes
- weighted graph: edges have values that indicate a property of the connection between two nodes. For example, stronger or weaker tie
- acyclic: no loop/cycle
- degree: the number of edges of a node (indegree/outdegree)

networks as graphs
=================================


- path: a sequence of nodes that can be traversed by traveling through edges from a starting node to an ending node.
- geodesic path: the shortest path between two nodes, path with minimum number of edges.

degree centrality
=================================

- The degree of a node: the number of edges attached to it
- A measure of the importance of a person: people with more friends tend to have more power,
i.e. How many persons you know?
      </script>
    </section>

    <section data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
eigenvector centrality
=================================

- Similar to degree centrality, but take into consideration the degree of the neighbors.
- The importance of a node is enhanced by its connectivity to the more important nodes (rather than to the less important ones)
- People with friends who have many (important) friends.How many persons you know and how important they are?
- Google PageRank,SocialRank

    <section data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
closeness centrality
=================================

- The reciprocal of the average length of geodesic paths between a node and all other nodes
- Closeness centrality measure how close you are in general with other people in the network


      </script>
    </section>

    <section data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
betweenness centrality
=================================

- the total proportion of geodesic paths between any two nodes in which the node of interest lies.
- A measure of how important a node in bridging the flow of information between other nodes.
