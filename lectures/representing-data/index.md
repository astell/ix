Lectures - Representing Data
=================================

## XML

This lecture explores the motivation behind markup languages to represent data (the need for human- and machine-readable meta-data). Presenting XML as a solution, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of using this format, and look in-depth at the syntax and usage of XML on the web, with some practical examples of data representation.

## JSON
Providing an alternative view-point to using XML, we look at JSON in this lecture. The history and relation to Javascript, its advantages and disadvantages compared to other data formats (XML, YAML, etc), and its usage and adoption in the development of more recent Internet technologies such as Big Data.
