Lectures - Representing Data
=================================

## XML

This lecture explores the motivation behind markup languages to represent data (the need for human- and machine-readable meta-data). Presenting XML as a solution, we examine the advantages and disadvantages of using this format, and look in-depth at the syntax and usage of XML on the web, with some practical examples of data representation.
