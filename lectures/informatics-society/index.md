- [Krebs on Security](http://www.krebsonsecurity.com/) -- Brian Krebs is an investigative journalist that specialises in exposing online criminal activity. Credit card fraud, spam king-pins, DDOS attack stories are his focused brief, which - with the required technology understanding - puts it well ahead of nearly any other technological journalism at the big agencies (he previously wrote for the Washington Post, but is now freelance as their red tape in exposure stories was too restrictive).

- [Security Now](http://www.grc.com/securitynow) -- Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte run a weekly two-hour podcast on Internet security news around the world. Again, the depth of technological detail and Steve's ability to clearly explain the issues, puts it streets ahead of other attempts in this space. An invaluable resource for staying ahead of nearly all tech news.
