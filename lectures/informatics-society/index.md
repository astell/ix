## Informatics in Society
These lectures give a short introduction to the impact of Data Science and Informatics on the real world. We explore the idea of "Big Data", including the pitfalls of definitions and marketing strategies, discuss some of the technical ideas involved in processing large data-sets, then move onto issues of data privacy. In the second lecture we dive more deeply into the issues of data privacy, technological security and show some of the mitigations that can be used to combat these issues.

- [Bad Science](http://www.badscience.net) -- Ben Goldacre is a medical doctor, journalist for the UK Guardian newspaper and author of several excellent books that delve into the ways in which the public can be misled and misinformed on issues of clinical science by drug companies and others.

- [Krebs on Security](http://www.krebsonsecurity.com/) -- Brian Krebs is an investigative journalist that specialises in exposing online criminal activity. Credit card fraud, spam king-pins, DDOS attack stories are his focused brief, which - with the required technology understanding - puts it well ahead of nearly any other technological journalism at the big agencies (he previously wrote for the Washington Post, but is now freelance as their red tape in exposure stories was too restrictive).

Again, the depth of technological detail and Steve's ability to clearly explain the issues, puts it streets ahead of other attempts in this space. An invaluable resource for staying ahead of nearly all tech news.
