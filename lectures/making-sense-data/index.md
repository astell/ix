Lectures - Making Sense of Data
===============================

## Analysing data

In this lecture we introduce some of the basic concepts of analytics. We’ve covered communication, formatting, raw data handling with spreadsheets and visualisation – this allows students to turn this into understanding of data-sets to answer real-life questions. Several examples are outlined where these methods are used in everyday life, the broad steps of data analysis are outlined and the concepts of grouping and prediction are introduced.

## Bivariate analysis

We look at the specific case of analysis of the relationship between two variables in this lecture. Starting with some simple examples of such relationships (direct, indirect, none and confounding variables), we move onto the distinction between discrete and continuous variables, various methods on how to convert a continuous variable to a discrete one, and some of the statistical tools that allow the measurement of relationships between discrete and continuous variables (e.g. Spearman’s rank correlation)
