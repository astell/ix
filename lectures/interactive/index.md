## Interactivity
The ability to interact with data through web applications is largely driven by one language: JavaScript. In these lectures we introduce the language with some basics on how to get up and running, the particular features that allow JavaScript to make websites interactive, and we cover the relationship between JavaScript, JSON and AJAX. In the second lecture we focus on the higher-level libraries that are built on top of JavaScript, such as JQuery, Bootstrap, D3 and HighCharts, which enable you to produce rich, visually-appealing and interactive output on the web.

- Crockford, "Javascript: the good parts" (2008), [Javascript: the good parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1425589713&sr=8-1&keywords=javascript+the+good+parts) -- As seen in the JSON lecture recommendations

- [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) -- a good beginner's primer for JavaScript, JQuery and AJAX

- [JQuery](http://www.jqueryui.com/) -- JQuery project home-page, good for showing basic demonstrations and supporting code (e.g. draggable, droppable, etc)

- [HighCharts](http://www.highcharts.com) -- useful framework for producing JavaScript-driven interactive data charts

- [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) -- one of the most useful frameworks in producing robust applications that will run on any browser or device

- [D3](http://d3js.org/) -- Data-Driven Documents, another package that allows you to produce beautiful applications, whilst binding directly to your data
