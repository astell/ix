## Interactivity
The ability to interact with data through web applications is largely driven by one language: JavaScript. In these lectures we introduce the language with some basics on how to get up and running, and some understanding of syntax and grammar. In the second lecture we focus on the more advanced techniques that give JavaScript it's interactive power and how you can use these within frameworks that enable you to produce rich and visually appealing output on the web.
