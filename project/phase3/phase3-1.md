Milestone 1 - Group Formation (to be completed by Friday week 4).

By the end of week 4, you must form a group of three students. Some of you might be tempted to do the phase 2 and 3 of the project individually, but working in group is one of the most important skills in software development or in any projects involving a large problem-solving work.

While having a group across workshop classes is permissible, try as much as possible to work with students in your allocated practical workshop because some of your workshop time will be allocated for doing group work.

The week 3 workshop is the best time for you to know your peers in more detail. Your tutor will help you to facilitate the group formation. In this workshop, your group should:
- Identify the strength/weakness of each team member
- Decide the best way to communicate (chat, email, facebook)
- Discuss how to share code (for example: Subversion/SVN, drop box, GoogleDocs)

Groupwork Guide

To work successfully in a team, please look at the following [guide](http://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=ddwg6czc_111fmpnw6c7&hl=en). In addition, we will require you to use a group subversion repository for all your work in this project, which your tutor should have helped you set up. If you do not have a group repository, please contact one of the subject coordinators as soon as possible. The repository should contain not just the final polished version of your code: you should be checking in intermediate versions that work to some extent, but are not yet complete, for instance. You should use it as a way of sharing files, and of keeping track of who has done what. Use the commit messages in subversion to assist in identifying what exactly you have contributed to the project, as well as your own development log files.
