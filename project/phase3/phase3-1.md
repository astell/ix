# Phase 3: Milestone 1 - Data Exploration.

By the end of week 4, you must ideally form a group of three students. Some of you might be tempted to do the phase 2 and 3 of the project individually, but working in group is one of the most important skills in software development or in any projects involving a large problem-solving work. Try as much as possible to form a group with students in your allocated practical workshop because some of your workshop time will be allocated for doing group work.

The first five workshops are the best time for you to know your peers in more detail. Your tutor will help you to facilitate the group formation. In this workshop, your group should:
- Identify the strength/weakness of each team member
- Decide the best way to communicate (chat, email, facebook, instagram, twitter)
- Discuss how to share code (Subversion/SVN, dropbox, GoogleDocs, bitbucket). Some of the options will be clarified later

These are some online resources that might be useful:

- [Doodle](http://doodle.com/) - simple scheduling, useful for finding meeting times
- [Trello](https://trello.com/) - Simple project management tool
- [invision](http://www.invisionapp.com/) - a more sophisticated prototyping and collaboration tool

## Data Exploration

Having a group for your phase 3, start off with the following tasks:

- In group, discuss and select a domain for your datasets. This can include any kind of discipline: music, finance, stock market data, commerce, physics, science, social media (twitter, facebook), or transport.
- Research and explore dataset(s) that can be used for phase 3.

  - http://www.data.gov/
  - http://www.abs.gov.au/
  - http://www.bom.gov.au/
  - http://www.cdc.gov/DataStatistics/
  - http://openflights.org/data.html
- The selected dataset (or datasets) should have reasonable amount of data. It should contain about 1000 rows, a number of dimensions (categorical values) and several measurements (numerical values). 
- You may select two different datasets that you may want to correlate from two different sources. For example: (i) dataset of birth rate by country from United Nations, and (ii) dataset of internet users by country from CIA World Factbook. 
- You may also select a dataset that contains geometry or geospatial information (location).
- The complexity and sophistication of your selected dataset(s) is part of the assessment.
- You will use the selected dataset to build a web application that helps you aggregate, summarise, investigate relationship among the attributes, and finding interesting patterns.

## Deliverables

By the end of week 6, you need to submit to your subject coordinator:

- The final team members
- Your choice of domain and candidate datasets

## Groupwork Guide

#### Working Successfully in a Team
Working in a team has several benefits. It encourages peer learning, it allows students to tackle larger problems, and it provides training for negotiations common in many workplaces. The goal of a groupwork project at university is not only to produce a successful output, but also to learn the skills required to manage a successful team. Groups that are able to coordinate and manage their activities successfully are more likely to do well. Groups that do not cooperate inevitably perform badly.

Occasionally groups experience difficulties, such as unmet expectations and unequal-participation. Remember that one of the goals is successfully managing these difficulties. We have found there are a few simple strategies can help avoid some of these difficulties:

- At the first meeting, exchange contact details (phone number, email) and arrange the details of the next meeting (time, place, agenda). 
- Keep minutes of all meetings. This should include, who attended, topics discussed, action items (who will do what when), details of next meeting (time, place, agenda)
- Keep everyone informed. Send minutes and agenda to all group members. Avoid side conversations that exclude one or more group members.

#### Assigning Groups

Once you have been assigned a group, moving to another group is most unlikely. You will need to have a compelling reason (e.g. illness). "Not getting along" is not a strong reason. All changes must be approved by the subject coordinator.

#### Declaration of Academic Honesty

Group work submissions must be accompanied by a [Declaration of Academic Honesty](assets/declaration-of-academic-honesty.pdf). In this form students declare that the work is their own (i.e. not plagiarised) and the individual contributions to the group activity.

####  Equal Contributions

It is assumed that all group members will make an equal contribution to the assignment. So, groups should attempt to divide the project workload evenly. Group assignments are typically assessed as a whole (unless otherwise stated). Different marks are not normally issued to individual students.

####  Unequal Contributions
Any student who believes that some member of the group is not making a reasonable contribution to the assignment, should to the following:

- Before submission, contact the tutor as soon as they feel that the group is not working effectively.
- After submission, summon the group to negotiate an agreed redistribution (e.g. 50% for student 1; 30% for student 2; 20% for student 3). If an agreement is reached, the coversheet with the appropriate distribution must be submitted.
- If an agreement cannot be reached, the group will need to arrange a meeting with one of the subject coordinators. All group members must attend the meeting. At this meeting a fair redistribution of workload will be negotiated. Students will need to provide evidence of attempts at successful group work; such as invitations to meetings (dated emails or SMS), minutes of meetings (with attendances), and other evidence of work (such as the development log). This evidence is essential before marks can be redistributed.
 
#### Groupwork Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. *Who owns the work created by the group?*<br />This is a thorny issue, but in general, the work is owned collectively by the group, not by the individual members. Of course this assumes equal contribution by all members.

2. *What happens if a group member does not do their fair share of the work?*<br />One potential problem with group projects is that one or more members of the group do not do their fair share of the work. Such people are said to "ride of the coat-tails of others". You can help prevent this from happening by apportioning tasks to group members early in the project, and keeping good records of what work each member agreed to do, when they were supposed to do it, and when they completed it. You may have disagreements about how to divide up the workload, but ultimately you will need a system in place to resolve such disputes. If all else fails, you should advise the teaching staff of any problems that you cannot resolve, as early as possible. The earlier these issues are raised, the more likelihood there is that a remedy will be found.

3. *How can we keep track of which person did which part of the work?*<br />By keeping clear written records throughout the duration of the project. If you are writing code, then it is good to keep a log of all the modifications that are made to the code, by which person, and on what date. You will each do this in your development log file. It is also essential to keep the revision history of the files you are working on. Subversion will assist you in this.

4. *What happens if certain members of the group have a major disagreement which cannot be reconciled within the group?*<br />Bring it to the attention of the teaching staff as early as possible.

5. *What can you do if you feel you are being unfairly treated by the other members of the group?*<br />Bring it to the attention of the teaching staff as early as possible.

6. *What happens if a group member quits the subject, or cannot be contacted by the other members?*<br />You will need to be prepared for this scenario. Obviously you should bring it to the attention of the teaching staff as early as possible. But it should also be possible for you to continue on with your work with one less person. The marking of projects will be fair and will consider such unforeseen circumstances.

7. *If you prefer to work on your own, can you submit an individual project?*<br />No.
