# Phase 3: Milestone 1 - Group Formation and Data Exploration

By the end of week 4, you must ideally form a group of three students. Some of you might be tempted to do the phase 2 and 3 of the project individually, but working in group is one of the most important skills in software development or in any projects involving a large problem-solving work. Try as much as possible to form a group with students in your allocated practical workshop because some of your workshop time will be allocated for doing group work.

The first five workshops are the best time for you to know your peers better. Your tutor will help you to facilitate the group formation. In the workshop, your group should:
- Identify the strength/weakness of each team member
- Decide the best way to communicate (chat, email, facebook, instagram, twitter)
- Discuss how to share code (Subversion/SVN, dropbox, GoogleDocs, bitbucket). Some of these options will be clarified later

These are some online resources that might be useful:

- [Doodle](http://doodle.com/) - simple scheduling, useful for finding meeting times
- [Trello](https://trello.com/) - Simple project management tool
- [invision](http://www.invisionapp.com/) - a more sophisticated prototyping and collaboration tool

## Data Exploration

Having a group for your phase 3, start off with the following tasks:

- In group, discuss and select a domain for your datasets. This can include any kind of discipline: music, finance, stock market data, commerce, physics, science, social media (twitter, facebook), or transport.
- Research and explore dataset(s) that can be used for phase 3.

- The selected dataset (or datasets) should have reasonable amount of data (at least hundreds of rows). It should contain a number of dimensions (categorical values) and several measurements (numerical values).
- You may select two different datasets that you may want to correlate from two different sources. For example: (i) dataset of birth rate by country from United Nations, and (ii) dataset of internet users by country from CIA World Factbook.
- You may also select a dataset that contains geometry or geospatial information (location).
- The complexity and the level of sophistication of your selected dataset(s) is part of the assessment.
- You will use the selected dataset to build a web application that helps you aggregate, summarise, investigate relationship among the attributes, and finding interesting patterns.

Use the following questions to discuss about the selected dataset:

- Is the data in tabular format?
- Is the number of data columns greater than the number of rows?
- What are the data types of the attribute columns?
- Is the dataset sparse (contains many missing items)?
- What is the license of data? Is it public domain? What is its *terms of use*?
