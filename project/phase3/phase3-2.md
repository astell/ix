Having a group for your phase 3, start off with the following tasks:

- Investigate how "data scientist" have use, manipulate, and present data:

  - http://www.theguardian.com/data
- In group, discuss and select a domain for your datasets. This can include any kind of discipline: music, finance, stock market data, commerce, physics, science, social media (twitter, facebook), or transport.
- Research and select dataset(s) that can be used for phase 3.

  - http://www.abs.gov.au/
  - http://www.bom.gov.au/
  - http://www.cdc.gov/DataStatistics/
  - http://openflights.org/data.html
- The selected dataset (or datasets) should have reasonable amount of data. It should contain about 1000 rows, a number of dimensions (categorical values) and several measurements (numerical values). 
- You may select two different datasets that you may want to correlate from two different sources. For example: (i) dataset of birth rate by country from United Nations, and (ii) dataset of internet users by country from CIA World Factbook. 
- You may also select a dataset that contains geometry or geospatial information (location).
- The complexity and sophistication of your selected dataset(s) is part of the assessment.
- You will use the selected dataset to build a web application that helps you aggregate, summarise, investigate relationship among the attributes, and finding interesting patterns.
