# Phase 3: Milestone 2 - Plan and Design

To help you implement what you have set to achieve for the **phase 3** of the project, address the issues outlined in the following checklist:

- **Application structure**<br />
Discuss the design of your application. You may want to follow separation of concerns for your implementation. For example, one member would work on the issue of data, one would work on the issue of presentation/visualisation, and one on the data processing. Try to break your application into multiple logical component. Define the input and output requirements of each module.
- **Code management**<br />
Discuss how you share your code. You may use IVLE's SVN or you may use [bitbucket](http://bitbukcet.com) or [Github](http://github.com). Please remember that Github's free service only provides public repository. As such, you may expose your code to other students in the class. This should be strictly avoidable for part 1 of the phase 3. The risk of exposure may not be so significant for part 2 but we would suggest that you get a private repository through Github's paid service. You can also use file sharing facility like dropbox if you have a clear cut separation of concerns for your application structure.
You may want to a group subversion repository for all your work in this project, which your tutor should have helped you set up. If you do not have a group repository, please contact one of the subject coordinators as soon as possible. The repository should contain not just the final polished version of your code: you should be checking in intermediate versions that work to some extent, but are not yet complete, for instance. You should use it as a way of sharing files, and of keeping track of who has done what. Use the commit messages in subversion to assist in identifying what exactly you have contributed to the project, as well as your own development log files. An exercise to help you use SVN can be found at [this page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yJWZXzkC6gA3nadkukTPCzUWLiuX0oTFqWAhpCpRNlI/pub).

- **Data management**<br />
Discuss how the data is stored and processed. The simplest way to store the data is using CSV file. Once your data is processed you can store your data in a intermediary CSV file or in [pickle](https://wiki.python.org/moin/UsingPickle) for faster processing. You can also use SQL-like datastore, [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/) in IVLE.
You are allowed to do some off-line data processing (outside IVLE) to speed up your data analysis. However, this should be documented and presented during final presentation because this is a very important aspect of analysis cycle.
- **The use of other Python libraries**<br />
You may use other Python libraries as long as they can be easily added to your IVLE's file space. [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is one of such libraries. It can be really useful when you need to process unstructured datasources and to convert them to structure data-sets like CSV.
- **The use of JavaScript and JavaScript libraries**<br />
You may use both Python and JavaScript in your application.

By week 10, your team should have already had:

- The final choice of dataset. You should have identified the type of the attributes (categorical or numerical) in the datasets.
- The plan and design for part 1 of phase 3.
- The plan and design for part 2 of phase 3. These should include 5 data analysis or visualisation items. You can either provide an in-depth analysis of a hypothesis (in which 5 visualisations are produced for 5 sub-questions of the hypothesis); or you can work with 5 hypothesis that have the same underlying theme (they form a story together about the data that you have chosen).
- Your plan should include the structure of your web application and the job responsibilities of each member.
- Discuss your plan with your tutor to see if you need to do more or too overambitious.

## Deliverables

By the end of week 10, you need to submit to your tutor:

- The final team members
- Final choice of domain and data-sets
