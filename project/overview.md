# Overview

The aim of the project is to give you practical experience with the following skills:

- **Understanding and Designing Data Representation**, including XML design, processing, and validation.
- **Presenting Data**, including visualisation and presentation using XHTML and CSS.
- **Basic Data Processing and Analysis Techniques**.
- **Providing a Way to Interact with Data**, including Python web programming.

The project is divided into three phases of increasing complexity. The first phase is done individually, and will serve as a preparatory step for the second and third phase, which will be done in **3-person groups**.

### Phase 1 – Design and analysis of data representation (individual, 10%, due in the beginning of week 5).

Your task is to produce XML data that contains some basic statistical properties of a given dataset. <a base="ix-project" href="phase1/index.md">Detail on phase 1</a>.

### Phase 2 – Solving a practical data manipulation problem (individual & group, 10%, due around week 8).

Your task is to solve some data processing problems by using your skills in managing, manipulating and visualising data in spreadsheet. <a base="ix-project" href="phase2/index.md">Detail on phase 2</a>.

### Phase 3 – Developing an application that enables the presentation, visualisation, and analysis of data (group, 20%, due around week 12).

You will build a non-trivial web-application, which demonstrates the various skills and technologies that you learn in the subject. It is also an opportunity for you to gain experience working in a team on a challenging task. Details on phase 3.

## Groupwork Guide

#### Working Successfully in a Team
Working in a team has several benefits. It encourages peer learning, it allows students to tackle larger problems, and it provides training for negotiations common in many workplaces. The goal of a groupwork project at university is not only to produce a successful output, but also to learn the skills required to manage a successful team. Groups that are able to coordinate and manage their activities successfully are more likely to do well. Groups that do not cooperate inevitably perform badly.

Occasionally groups experience difficulties, such as unmet expectations and unequal-participation. Remember that one of the goals is successfully managing these difficulties. We have found there are a few simple strategies can help avoid some of these difficulties:

- At the first meeting, exchange contact details (phone number, email) and arrange the details of the next meeting (time, place, agenda).
- Keep minutes of all meetings. This should include, who attended, topics discussed, action items (who will do what when), details of next meeting (time, place, agenda)
- Keep everyone informed. Send minutes and agenda to all group members. Avoid side conversations that exclude one or more group members.

#### Assigning Groups

Once you have been assigned a group, moving to another group is most unlikely. You will need to have a compelling reason (e.g. illness). "Not getting along" is not a strong reason. All changes must be approved by the subject coordinator.

#### Declaration of Academic Honesty

Group work submissions must be accompanied by a [Declaration of Academic Honesty](assets/declaration-of-academic-honesty.pdf). In this form students declare that the work is their own (i.e. not plagiarised) and the individual contributions to the group activity.

####  Equal Contributions

It is assumed that all group members will make an equal contribution to the assignment. So, groups should attempt to divide the project workload evenly. Group assignments are typically assessed as a whole (unless otherwise stated). Different marks are not normally issued to individual students.

####  Unequal Contributions
Any student who believes that some member of the group is not making a reasonable contribution to the assignment, should to the following:

- Before submission, contact the tutor as soon as they feel that the group is not working effectively.
- After submission, summon the group to negotiate an agreed redistribution (e.g. 50% for student 1; 30% for student 2; 20% for student 3). If an agreement is reached, the coversheet with the appropriate distribution must be submitted.
- If an agreement cannot be reached, the group will need to arrange a meeting with one of the subject coordinators. All group members must attend the meeting. At this meeting a fair redistribution of workload will be negotiated. Students will need to provide evidence of attempts at successful group work; such as invitations to meetings (dated emails or SMS), minutes of meetings (with attendances), and other evidence of work (such as the development log). This evidence is essential before marks can be redistributed.

#### Groupwork Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

1. *Who owns the work created by the group?*<br />
This is a thorny issue, but in general, the work is owned collectively by the group, not by the individual members. Of course this assumes equal contribution by all members.

2. *What happens if a group member does not do their fair share of the work?*<br />
One potential problem with group projects is that one or more members of the group do not do their fair share of the work. Such people are said to "ride of the coat-tails of others". You can help prevent this from happening by apportioning tasks to group members early in the project, and keeping good records of what work each member agreed to do, when they were supposed to do it, and when they completed it. You may have disagreements about how to divide up the workload, but ultimately you will need a system in place to resolve such disputes. If all else fails, you should advise the teaching staff of any problems that you cannot resolve, as early as possible. The earlier these issues are raised, the more likelihood there is that a remedy will be found.

3. *How can we keep track of which person did which part of the work?*<br />
By keeping clear written records throughout the duration of the project. If you are writing code, then it is good to keep a log of all the modifications that are made to the code, by which person, and on what date. You will each do this in your development log file. It is also essential to keep the revision history of the files you are working on. Version control tools or code management tools (like Subversion) will assist you in this.

4. *What happens if certain members of the group have a major disagreement which cannot be reconciled within the group?*<br />
Bring it to the attention of the teaching staff as early as possible.

5. *What can you do if you feel you are being unfairly treated by the other members of the group?*<br />
Bring it to the attention of the teaching staff as early as possible.

6. *What happens if a group member quits the subject, or cannot be contacted by the other members?*<br />
You will need to be prepared for this scenario. Obviously you should bring it to the attention of the teaching staff as early as possible. But it should also be possible for you to continue on with your work with one less person. The marking of projects will be fair and will consider such unforeseen circumstances.

7. *If you prefer to work on your own, can you submit an individual project?*<br />
No.
