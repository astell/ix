Introduction
------------

The aim of the project is to give you practical experience with the skills that you learn in the subject, namely:

- **Understanding and Designing Data Representation**, including XML design, processing, and validation.
- **Providing a Way to Interact with Data**, including Python web programming.
- **Basic Data Processing and Analysis Techniques**.
- **Presenting Data**, including visualisation and presentation using XHTML and CSS.

The project is divided into three phases of increasing complexity. The first phase is done individually, and will serve as a preparatory step for the second and third phase, which will be done in **3-person groups**.

### Phase 1 – Design and analysis of data representation (individual, 10%, due around week 4).

Your task is to produce XML data that contains some basic statistical properties of a given dataset. <a base="ix-project" href="phase1/index.md">Detail on phase 1</a>.

### Phase 2 – Solving a practical data manipulation problem (individual & group, 10%, due around week 8).

Your task is to solve some data processing problems by using your skills in managing, manipulating and visualising data in spreadsheet. Detail on phase 2.

### Phase 3 – Developing an application that enables the presentation, visualisation, and analysis of data (group, 20%, due around week 12).

You will build a non-trivial web-application, which demonstrates the skills and technologies that you have learnt in the subject. It is also an opportunity for you to gain experience working in a team on a challenging task. Details on phase 3.
